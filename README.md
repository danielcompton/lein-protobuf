lein-protobuf is a [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) plugin for compiling
[Google Protobuf](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) `.proto` files into Java `.class` files. It
can be used with or without [clojure-protobuf](https://github.com/flatland/clojure-protobuf), which
is a Clojure wrapper around the Java protobuf API.

## Getting started

Add the following to your `project.clj` file:

    :plugins [[lein-protobuf "0.5.0"]]

Replace `"0.5.0"` with the actual latest version: [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/lein-protobuf.svg)](https://clojars.org/lein-protobuf)

Also, you should add the version of the protobuf library to your dependencies in `project.clj` corresponding to the version of `protoc` being used:

    :dependencies [[com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java "2.6.1"]]

*Note: lein-protobuf requires at least version 2.0 of Leiningen.*

## Usage

By default, lein-protobuf looks for `.proto` files in `resources/proto` in your project
directory. This was chosen as the default location so that `.proto` files would also be included in
your jar files. You can change this with:

    :proto-path "path/to/proto"

You can specify custom protoc executable with:

    :protoc "/usr/local/bin/protoc260"

To compile all `.proto` files in this directory, just run:

    lein protobuf

You can also compile specific proto files with:

    lein protobuf file1.proto file2.proto

We also add a hook to Leiningen's `compile` task, so `.proto` files will automatically be compiled
before that task runs. So if you like, you can simply run:

    lein compile

## Protoc versions

Protoc version | lein-protobuf version
---------------|----------------------
2.6.1          | 0.4.3
2.5.0          | 0.4.0
